          <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Robert Odell and I have a
            great idea for a website. Do you like classic cars? Well, you’re not
            alone. Thousands of people out there own a classic car, or perhaps
            they are just fans of them. I am proposing a website where people
            can come and learn about classic cars. There will be different
            sections based on decade, style, and models. Not only will you learn
            the history of each car, but you can also chat with other car owners
            and buy or sell cars or parts. Don’t you think this is a great idea?

          <h3>Site Map and Content</h3>

          <h4>Classic Car History</h4>
          <p>
            This page will include history of different classic cars. It will be
            grouped into decades. I would like to tell the history and
            significance of the decade and include some vehicles to showcase.
            For the initial release of the site there will be a small number of
            vehicles, but I would like to design the page to easily grow as new
            cars are added. There can be a different car showcased each month.
          </p>
          <h4>Buy and Sell</h4>
          <p>
            This page will be designed to display a listing of vehicles for
            sale. The plan is to allow users to post their cars for sell like a
            classified ad. Users can also post classic car parts for sell of ISO
            ads to look for those hard-to-find parts.
          </p>
          <h4>Discusion Board</h4>
          <p>
            This page will be a place where you can search for post in a
            discussion board. The topics can range from general chat to DYI
            tutorials and writeups. This will most likely be a nonfunctioning
            design at first to show the concept. Post will be moderated to limit
            improper post or behaviors to provide a wholesome and family
            friendly atmosphere. For the initial release of the site this will
            be a basic how-to and information page.
