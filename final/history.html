          <h3>1960 Rise of the Compacts</h3>
          <div class="float-left">
            <img
              class="style-img"
              src="images/corvair.jpg"
              alt="1962 Chevy Corvair"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            The 1960's saw a demand for smaller more compact cars. The
            Volkswagen bug and other foreign models were gaining popularity in
            the US. Due to this demand the big three US auto companies answered
            the call. In 1960 Ford introduced the Falcon, Chevy introduced the
            Corvair, and Plymouth introduced the Valiant. All small, lightweight
            6-cylinder cars.
          </p>

          <h3>1964 The Muscle Era Begins</h3>
          <div class="float-right">
            <img class="style-img" src="images/gto.jpg" alt="Pontiac GTO" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Although compacts were popular in the early 60s, the public had a
            demand for speed. This was answered by the muscle cars and pony
            cars. Muscle cars were mid-sized cars such as the Pontiac GTO, Chevy
            Chevelle, Ford Galaxy, and Dodge Charger. Pony cars were smaller
            compact cars like the Ford Mustang, Plymouth Barracuda, and Chevy
            Camaro. The idea was to put the biggest engine possible into these
            small and mid-sized cars to make them go extremely fast.
          </p>
          <h3>1968 Safety Crackdown</h3>
          <p>
            As a response to the ever-increasing fast cars that were being
            released. Safety became a concern. The mid to late 60â€™s saw the
            beginning of numerous safety mandates. Starting in 1966 seatbelts
            were no longer an option, they became mandatory. In 1968 the
            Federal-Aid Highway Act was passed, and many more safety mandates
            came into effect.
