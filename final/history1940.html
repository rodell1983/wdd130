          <h3>Short Lived Success</h3>

          <p>
            The 1930s saw many luxuries become standard. Electric starters,
            synchromesh transmissions, automatic chokes, and Ford came out with
            the flathead V8. The 40’s started out on a high note for car
            innovation. This however was short lived. The world was at war and
            car production needed to switch to tank, aircraft, and weapons
            production.

          </div>
          <h3>No Cars for the Public</h3>
          <p>
            By 1943 no cars were being produced at all for the general public.
            The big car makers were still in business though. Ford was building
            the B24 Liberator, jeeps, and tank engines. GM built aircraft
            engines, guns, ammo, and military trucks. Chrysler built air raid
            sirens and the B-29 engines. All manufacturing efforts were being
            made to the war.
          </p>
          <h3>Rise Again</h3>
          <div class="float-right">
            <img class="style-img" src="images/tucker.jpg" alt="Tucker Car" />
          </div>
          <p>
            After the success of winning the war, car manufacturing started up
            again. We even saw some new manufacturers on the block. The big
            three US car makers started up production and the first batch of
            cars were still basically 30’s era at first. Preston Tucker
            introduced his car in 1948 and it was so advanced and innovative
            that it scared the major companies into making some changes. It came
            with seatbelts, rear engine, three headlights, and numerous safety
            features. Unfortunately, he was ran out of business but, he made a
            huge impact on the automotive industry. The 50’s were about to see a
            major boom (in cars as well as babies)
