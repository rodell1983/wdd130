          <h3>Golden Era</h3>
          <div class="float-right">

          </div>

          <p>
            The 50’s saw a huge boom in cars, both with sales and innovation.
            American soldiers had returned from the war, moved to the suburbs
            and started their families. This meant having a car was essential.
            The car companies were ready to meet demand and they had a few
            tricks up their sleeves. A new concept for the 50’s became standard.
            Car companies started changing the car design every year to keep
            Americans wanting the latest model. This lasted throughout the
            decade into the 60s.
          </p>

          <h3>Hot Rods and the Need for Speed</h3>

          <p>
            Another phenomenon happened as a result from all those young men
            returning from action. They had a need for speed. In the 1950’s the
            hotrod was introduced. This meant take as much weight and
            unnecessary metal off the car and put the biggest engine you can in
            it (Sounds like a prelude to the muscle car) Car makers answered the
            call with the Corvette and the Thunderbird, although neither
            technically considered hotrods.

            <img
              class="style-img"
              src="images/chevy-belair.jpg"
              alt="Chevy Belair"
            />
          </div>
          <h3>Bigger is Better</h3>
          <p>
            In 1955 chevy introduce the first car in one of the most iconic
            series of cars. As mentioned earlier, the car makers came up with
            the standard of changing car models every year. This caused them to
            have to “one up” themselves each time. As a result, cars were
            getting bigger and flashier each year. This patten can be seen
            between 1955 -1957 in chevy cars; they were better each year.
            However, by 1958 car makers had resorted to adding bigger tailfins
            and more headlight and the cars had just become pricier and more
            bloated. Americans will soon want to ditch these giant cars for
            something smaller and more economical.
