          <h3>Death of the Muscle Car</h3>
          
          <p>
            1970 saw the peak of the muscle car era however it was about to be
            killed. Not only were safety mandates changing cars performance, but
            emissions were also being regulated. In 1973 all cars were required
            to have crash rated front and rear bumpers, so the cool stylish
            chrome bumpers were all replaced with large and bulky bumpers that
            could withstand a collision. In 1974 all cars were required to be
            equipped with catalytic converters and gasoline was required to be
            unleaded. This cause performance to hit an all-time low.

          <h3>Oil Embargo</h3>

          <p>
            Just when the auto industry though it couldn’t get any worse the oil
            embargo hit in the mid 70’s. Although the performance of cars was
            severely hurt by emissions regulation, most cars were still gas
            hogs. During this time gasoline was hard to come by. People had to
            wait in long lines and were limited to how much fuel they could buy.
            This was the nail in the coffin to muscle cars and the birth of the
            subcompact and foreign invasion.
          </p>
          <h3>Sub Compacts and Imports</h3>
          <p>
            Starting in the early 70s the writing was on the wall. American car
            makers had to do something for the upcoming emissions and fuel
            shortages. Fords answer was the pinto and Chevys was the Vega. By
            the mid 70’s AMC came out with the pacer. This was an attempt to
            answer the emissions crackdown, fuel shortage, and a new phenomenon
            that was starting. Americans were starting to buy foreign cars. Car
            buyers wanted smaller and more economical cars and the new American
            subcompact were not cutting it. Buy the end of the 70s the amount of
            foreign (specifically) Asian cars had exploded. Stay tune for the
            80’s where we’ll discuss the Asian invasion.
